// Package kernel — scheduling-decision recorder.

// The Scheduling Observatory (dashboard.md §7) exists to explain WHY a task
// was assigned to a particular agent: the candidate pool, each candidate's
// capability-overlap / load / confidence / priority scores, and the final
// winner. This file records one decision per Schedule call into a bounded
// ring buffer so the panel can render the decision trail without the
// scheduler exposing internal mutation paths.
