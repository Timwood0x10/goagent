// Scheduler is the "no leader" execution engine (ares-runtime.md:
// "Agents are not orchestrated. They are scheduled."). It repeatedly drains
// the fabric's ReadyTasks — the work source — and for each ready task:
//
//	Schedule (capability-aware) → Acquire (lease + fencing) → RunQuantum (one
//	agent step) → finalize (COMPLETED / FAILED / SUSPENDED).
//
// No leader decides "B is done, now run C"; the fabric's dependency-completed
// states make C ready. The scheduler is only a consumer of ReadyTasks.
//
// Failure policy: a scheduling or execution failure for one task is logged and
// the loop continues — one bad task must never take down the scheduler.
//
// Dynamic executor registration: RegisterExecutor / UnregisterExecutor
// let the recovery loop inject a replacement agent at runtime so a recovered
// task is executed by a real executor, not a phantom agent. execMu guards the
