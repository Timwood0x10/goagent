// deploymentStagingRuntime is a shadow runtime used by the DeploymentPipeline.
// It NEVER mutates live state — Apply is a read-only preflight (the patch must
// have a registered executor) and Evaluate returns per-strategy fitness scores
// from the shared EvidenceStore: the shadow score for the staged patch's
// strategy and the baseline score for the currently-active strategy.
//
// Per-patch scoping: Apply records the patch's StrategyID as the candidate
// strategy, and Evaluate queries the aggregator for both the candidate
// (shadow) and the active (baseline) strategy in the same call against the
// same store snapshot. Previously Evaluate used an empty strategy filter
// (global mean), so every patch got the same score regardless of content.
//
// Attribution is required, not inferred: an empty StrategyID is NOT
// backfilled from Source or Target — those are proposer classes and component
// names, disjoint from the evidence store's strategy_id namespace. An
// unattributable patch is reported as unmeasurable (delta 0 → rejected by any
// positive PromotionThreshold) rather than scored against a key that can
// never match.
//
// Cold start: when no evidence exists for a strategy (Window count == 0),
// Evaluate returns coldStartScore for that strategy. There is NO implicit
// default — bootstrap sets it explicitly (0.5) at construction.
//
// Concurrency: currentPatchStrategy is mutable state across calls. Deploy
// holds dp.mu for the entire Deploy lifecycle, so there is no concurrent
// Evaluate during a single Deploy. But MonitorAndRollback also holds dp.mu,
// so the staging runtime's mutable state is guarded by the pipeline's mutex.
// The baseline is resolved live via asm.Current() at Evaluate time (the ASM
// reference is immutable after construction), so it is not mutable runtime
// state. go test -race covers this.
