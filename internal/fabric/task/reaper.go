// Reaper periodically harvests terminal fabric tasks so the in-memory task
// map does not grow monotonically across a server lifetime (M2-⑤, §9:
// "fabric 不自动回收终态任务"). The reaper is a housekeeping loop, NOT a
// correctness mechanism — terminal tasks are garbage once their results have
// been read by the caller.
//
// Harvesting rules:
//   - Only COMPLETED and FAILED tasks are eligible (READY/LEASED/RUNNING/
//     SUSPENDED are live or resumable and must survive).
//   - A session prefix filter ("sess/<id>/") limits harvesting to L2 session
//     tasks; non-session tasks (collab-*, peer-task-*) are invisible to this
//     reaper. The collab GC loop (cmd/ares/collab_graph.go) already handles
//     its own prefix.
//   - A grace period prevents harvesting a task that just completed — the
//     planner/answer path may still be reading its envelope when the state
//     transition lands. The default grace is 30s.
//
// The reaper runs as a managed background loop (like runCollabGCLoop), exited
// by closing its done channel. It is NOT on the scheduler drain path.
//
// Keep-set (P0-1): wall-clock grace alone is unsafe for a session that
// outlives the grace period — its early predecessors would be harvested while
// the planner still reads their envelopes for context assembly (decision C).
// A wired keep predicate makes the session registry the authority: a task
// whose owning session is still live is NEVER harvested, no matter its age;
// grace then only protects the read window racing a session's release.
