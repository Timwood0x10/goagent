// pluginBusHook adapts runtime.PluginBus to the kernel.QuantumHook
// contract, so the runtime plugin ecosystem (observer/checkpoint/tool/...)
// participates in the Agent OS scheduling loop without the kernel depending on
// the runtime package (the adapter lives in the cmd assembly layer — the only
// place allowed to import both).
//
// Mapping: the bus speaks workflow Step/StepResult; a scheduling quantum is
// projected as a single-step workflow whose ID is the fabric task id.
//
// The hook ALSO drives the kernel loop clock (W-L1): every LoopRoundQuanta
// quanta closes one loop round through the registered LoopPlugin — the "beat"
// of the evolution clock. Concurrency contract (QuantumHook may be invoked
// from concurrent drains):
//   - the boundary decision uses the atomic.AddInt64 RETURN value, never
//     Add-then-Load — Add-then-Load lets two drains read the same counter
//     value (double-fire) or skip past a multiple (lost round);
//   - the round BUDGET is likewise derived from that return value, not from
//     the stop flag: a flag is read-then-set, so concurrent boundary callers
//     all observe "not stopped" before any of them latches it and each would
//     settle its own over-budget round. Deriving the round number from the
//     caller's own unique count makes the budget order-independent.
//   - the stop flag is its own atomic.Bool, kept purely as a fast path so an
//     exhausted clock stops touching the plugin on every later quantum.
